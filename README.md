Tool for applying dithering to images.

Adapted from https://github.com/NielsLeenheer/CanvasDither/ (MIT)

### Ideas

- Split, dither, and recombine by channel
- Pre dither scaling, smoothing optional
- scale setting for social
- Customize bayer thresholds
- Mask, paint, and combine dithering algos
- Apply gradients over bg / foreground
